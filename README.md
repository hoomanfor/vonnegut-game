# Vonnegut Memory Game

This game will test your memory. Try not to click the same book twice. You earn 1 point for each unique book you click. The highest score you can earn is 12. If you accidentally click the same book twice, your score will reset to 0.  

I developed this game using the React JavaScript Library. I've deployed this game onto Github Pages: [https://hoomanfor.github.io/vonnegut-game/](https://hoomanfor.github.io/vonnegut-game/)
